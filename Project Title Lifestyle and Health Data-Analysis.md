**Project Title: Lifestyle and Health Data Analysis**



📘 **1. Project Overview**



The Lifestyle and Health Data Analysis project focuses on exploring how various lifestyle factors — such as diet, exercise, sleep, stress, and habits — influence an individual’s health status. Using real or simulated datasets, the project employs data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to identify correlations and trends between daily routines and health indicators like BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and mental well-being.



The primary goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help individuals, healthcare professionals, or organizations promote healthier lifestyles through data-driven recommendations.



🎯 **2. Objectives**



To understand how lifestyle habits impact physical and mental health.



To analyze correlations between health indicators (BMI, blood pressure, etc.) and lifestyle patterns.



To visualize trends and relationships in the dataset using plots and dashboards.



To apply machine learning models to predict potential health risks based on lifestyle data.



To provide recommendations for improving overall well-being.



📊 **3. Dataset Description**



Source: Public health or wellness datasets from platforms like Kaggle, WHO, or UCI Machine Learning Repository (e.g., Lifestyle and Health Indicators Dataset).

Alternatively, you can use a custom-collected survey dataset.

Lifestyle                	Diet type, Daily steps, Exercise frequency, Screen time, Sleep duration, Smoking/alcohol use

Health Indicators	BMI, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Glucose level, Cholesterol

Mental Health	        Stress level, Mood score, Work-life balance rating

Outcomes            	Overall Health Score, Risk Level (e.g., low/medium/high)



Data Size: 1,000–10,000 entries (depending on dataset source)



🔧 **4. Tools and Technologies**



Languages: Python (or R)



Libraries:



Data Handling: pandas, numpy



Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly



Machine Learning: scikit-learn, xgboost



Statistical Analysis: scipy, statsmodels



Platforms: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab



Optional: Power BI or Tableau for dashboard visualization



🧮 **5. Methodology**



Step 1: Data Collection



Obtain dataset from Kaggle or conduct a survey.



Verify data completeness and relevance.



Step 2: Data Cleaning



Handle missing values (mean/median imputation or removal).



Remove duplicates and outliers.



Convert categorical data (e.g., gender, diet type) using encoding methods.



Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance).



Visualizations:



Heatmap for correlation between health metrics and lifestyle factors.



Histograms for sleep duration, exercise time, BMI distribution.



Boxplots for outlier detection.



Identify trends such as:



“Higher sleep duration is associated with lower stress.”



“Sedentary lifestyle correlates with higher BMI.”



Step 4: Feature Engineering



Create new features like “Active Hours per Day” or “Sleep Quality Index.”



Normalize or scale data for model training.



Step 5: Predictive Modeling



Build models to predict health outcomes:



Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression) for predicting BMI or blood pressure.



Classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to classify health risk levels (Low/Medium/High).



Evaluate model performance using:



Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (for classification)



RMSE, MAE (for regression)



Step 6: Insights and Interpretation



Summarize major findings:



Lifestyle factors most affecting health.



Recommended daily habits to maintain good health.



Predictive power of different variables.



Step 7: Data Visualization Dashboard (Optional)



Create an interactive dashboard in Tableau/Power BI/Plotly Dash.



Visualize:



BMI vs Exercise Time



Stress Level vs Sleep Duration



Health Score by Age Group



💡 **6. Sample Insights**



People sleeping less than 6 hours per night showed 25% higher average stress levels.



Individuals with balanced diets and regular exercise have a lower BMI and cholesterol.



Screen time negatively correlates with sleep quality.



Predictive model achieves 82% accuracy in classifying health risk levels.



📈 **7. Expected Outcomes**



A clean, well-analyzed dataset revealing strong relationships between lifestyle and health.



Predictive models capable of identifying individuals at higher health risk.



Visualizations and dashboards for communicating insights effectively.



Data-driven recommendations for improving daily habits.
